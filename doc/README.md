Cyanite Documentation
=====================

This directory contains the build system for Cyanite's
documentation, based on [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org).

You will need both [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) and
the [read the docs theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme) for sphinx.

Once these dependencies are available, you can build the documentation
locally by running `make html`.

Up to date docs will also be published on http://cyanite.io
